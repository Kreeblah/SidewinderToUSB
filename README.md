# SidewinderToUSB
A PCB layout for the 3DP-Vert R3 Sidewinder adaptor code, using Fritzing.

The circuit itself is an implementation of adapt-ffb-joy (minus the trim pots) from https://code.google.com/archive/p/adapt-ffb-joy/downloads

The compiled code to use with this project is available at https://code.google.com/archive/p/sw3dprousb/downloads

Gameport part taken from https://github.com/shadwork/Arduino-PC-Gameport-HID/blob/master/Schematic/DB15%20Connector.fzpz

I've never laid out a PCB before, so this may have issues.  I'm currently waiting on my boards and parts in order to be able to test.
